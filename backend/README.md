# Disaster Resilience 2018 Backend Applicaton Server

This is a simple example repo to quickstart a [DRF](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) API within a Docker container.

Allows for multiple environments to run API, through series of docker-compose files. You should be able to replace the Django Code, making a few updates and get this running with a new API or existing one.

## Main Parts of Repo

## Contributors and History

This repo represents the work of many members of the Hack Oregon project team. The roots of this work began with the [2017 backend-service-pattern](https://github.com/hackoregon/backend-service-pattern), the work of the DevOps and platform teams, and the APIs deployed for the 2017 seasons.

This current implementation builds on the [transportation-system-backend](https://github.com/hackoregon/transportation-system-backend) and [passenger_census_api](https://github.com/hackoregon/passenger_census_api). The database structure is an implementation of the PostGIS container of the **data-science-pet-containers** repo. The application and database docker images are an implementation of the **backend-exemplar-2018** repo.
