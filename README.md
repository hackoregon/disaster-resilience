# disaster-resilience
Disaster Resilience - 2018 project season. 

## Analytics Branch

This branch should contain all analysis to be done on the Disaster Resiliance project. For the
moment, your results should be in a Jupyter notebook.  As we progress
through the project and have a need to upload results into a table to be served
by an API, we will continue to develop our data architecture.
